# Personal Webpage

This is my personal webpage built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion and hosted on Vercel.

Inspired by this [template](https://github.com/j471n/j471n.in).

## Usage

Start by installing the dependancies:
```shell
npm install
```

Populate the `env.local` file with environment variables and spin up a development environment using:
```shell
npm run dev
```
